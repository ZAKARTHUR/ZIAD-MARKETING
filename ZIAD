✅ Here's the Right Way to Publish Your HTML on GitHub Pages:
🛠 STEP 1: Upload Your index.html File
Go to your GitHub repository (example: https://github.com/kirubeladugna/ziad-marketing)

Click the "Add file" button > then click "Upload files"

Drag and drop your index.html file

Scroll down — in the Commit changes section:

Add a message like: Add homepage

Click the green "Commit changes" button

🌐 STEP 2: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to your repository’s homepage

Click the “⚙️ Settings” tab (top-right)

On the left sidebar, scroll down to Pages (or type pages in the search bar)

Under “GitHub Pages” > “Source”, do this:

Select main as the branch

Select / (root) as the folder

Click “Save”

✅ After 30–60 seconds, your site will be published at:

php-template
Copy
Edit
https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
For example:

arduino
Copy
Edit
https://kirubeladugna.github.io/ziad-marketing/
❗ If You Don't See the "Save" Button
Make sure:

You already committed at least one file (index.html)

The repository is public (GitHub Pages doesn’t work on private repos unless you're on Pro)

You're in the correct repo settings, under the Pages section

👇 Want me to help generate the .zip file for you?
I can package everything for upload, just say: "Zip it for me", and I’ll send you the downloadable version.

Let me know if you want a logo, favicon, or even to link the contact form with email
